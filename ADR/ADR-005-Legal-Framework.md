# ADR-005: Legal Framework (INCIBE SDS)

## Date
2026-01-25

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Compliance with national security standards (INCIBE System Design Specification - SDS) is mandatory for all engineering projects developed within the C23 Software Factory to ensure legal and technical alignment with Spanish cybersecurity regulations.

## Decision
The C23 Software Factory will follow a strict licensing policy to ensure intellectual property flexibility:
- **Software Licensing**: All software developed must be licensed under the **Apache License 2.0**. 
- **Rationale**: This license allows for both open-source distribution and commercial exploitation (generating economic benefit) without mandatory reciprocity, supporting diverse business models.

## Consequences
- Every project must undergo a legal feasibility review regarding license compatibility.
- The project's intellectual property can be managed versatilely (OSS or commercialized).
- Legal risks related to proprietary vs. open-source usage are minimized.
